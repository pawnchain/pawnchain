# PawnChain Networks

A peer-to-peer triangular pyramid investment system designed to manage user referrals, investments, and payouts through a structured 15-position hierarchical tree.

## Project Overview

PawnChain Networks enables users to earn referral bonuses and receive payouts upon triangle completion. The system features:

- Structured referral tracking with multi-format support (ObjectId, username, short code)
- Secure and auditable transaction lifecycle with real-time status updates
- Automated position assignment and triangle completion logic
- Admin-controlled deposit and payout confirmation for security

- **Main application**: Next.js 15 (React Server Components)
- **Standalone frontend**: React/Vite
