# Changelog

All notable changes to the PawnChain Networks project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] - 2025-09-08

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Earnings Display**: Corrected the Royal Treasury Balance calculation on the user dashboard to match the values shown on the wallet page.
- **Total Conquered Value**: Fixed the "Total Conquered" display on the user dashboard to show position earnings instead of the raw total earned value.
- **Earnings Consistency**: Ensured consistent earnings calculations across dashboard and wallet components by using the same data sources and formulas.

### Changed

- **User Dashboard Data Fetching**: Enhanced the dashboard to fetch wallet data for accurate earnings display.
- **Wallet Value Calculations**: Updated value calculations to properly reflect position-based earnings according to the defined multipliers (4x for Level 1, 3x for Level 2, etc.).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-04

### Fixed

- **Admin Users Dashboard Issue**: Resolved the problem where the admin users page was not displaying any users despite users existing in the database.
  - Fixed frontend components ([ChessAdminUsers.tsx](file:///C:/Users/kaygo/Downloads/project-bolt-github-oiwyqhd6/project/src/components/Admin/ChessAdminUsers.tsx) and [AdminUsers.tsx](file:///C:/Users/kaygo/Downloads/project-bolt-github-oiwyqhd6/project/src/components/Admin/AdminUsers.tsx)) to correctly handle the API response format.
  - The API returns a direct array of users, but the frontend was expecting an object with a [users](file:///C:/Users/kaygo/Downloads/project-bolt-github-oiwyqhd6/project/node_modules/@types/node/globals.d.ts#L105-L105) property.
  - Added proper error handling and empty state management.

- **MongoDB Soft Delete Filtering**: Fixed an issue with the MongoDB query where the [deletedAt: null](file:///C:/Users/kaygo/Downloads/project-bolt-github-oiwyqhd6/project/node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts#L1493-L1493) filter wasn't working properly.
  - Implemented manual filtering of deleted users in the admin users API endpoint.
  - This ensures that soft-deleted users are properly excluded from the admin dashboard as specified in the PRD.

- **Admin Dashboard Triangle Statistics**: Resolved a critical error in the admin overview API endpoint where the Prisma [groupBy](file:///C:/Users/kaygo/Downloads/project-bolt-github-oiwyqhd6/project/node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts#L2353-L2356) operation was failing with MongoDB.
  - Replaced the problematic [groupBy](file:///C:/Users/kaygo/Downloads/project-bolt-github-oiwyqhd6/project/node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts#L2353-L2356) operation with manual grouping logic.
  - Added proper error handling to prevent dashboard crashes when triangle data is incomplete.

### Changed

- **API Response Consistency**: Updated the admin users API endpoint to return data in a consistent format that matches frontend expectations.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in admin API endpoints with better logging and user-friendly error messages.

### Technical Debt

- **MongoDB groupBy Issue**: The Prisma MongoDB connector has known issues with [groupBy](file:///C:/Users/kaygo/Downloads/project-bolt-github-oiwyqhd6/project/node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts#L2353-L2356) operations. This has been worked around but should be monitored for future Prisma updates.

## [PRD Compliance Notes]

### âœ… Implemented Features from PRD v3.0

1. **Database Architecture**:
   - MongoDB Atlas integration with proper ObjectId handling
   - Soft delete implementation with [deletedAt](file:///C:/Users/kaygo/Downloads/project-bolt-github-oiwyqhd6/project/node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts#L1493-L1493) timestamp
   - Proper schema migration from SQLite to MongoDB

2. **User Management**:
   - Admin dashboard correctly filters out deleted users
   - User data properly displayed with plan information and referral details

3. **Transaction System**:
   - Admin overview API provides transaction statistics
   - Real-time updates via Socket.io (as per PRD specifications)

4. **Security & Compliance**:
   - Proper authentication validation in admin endpoints
   - Data protection through proper filtering of sensitive information

### ðŸ“‹ Outstanding Items from PRD

1. **Dual Frontend Architecture**: 
   - PRD specifies a React/Vite standalone frontend (Port 5173) in addition to the main Next.js application (Port 3000)
   - Development command `npm run dev:all` for concurrent server startup is referenced but not implemented in package.json

2. **Enhanced Transaction ID Format**:
   - PRD specifies formatted transaction IDs (DP12345, WD12345, RB12345) but implementation status needs verification

3. **Modal Transaction Flow**:
   - PRD requires non-closable modals for transaction processes which needs verification
